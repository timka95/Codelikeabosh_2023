    <h1>Determining the Important Object</h1>
    <p>In this scenario, we consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If it's closer to us</li>
        <li>And where we are going right now</li>
        <li>So it is a collision threat</li>
        <li>Then it will be important to make a decision upon that</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There will be only one situation in this environment: the car is turning after the start.</p>

    <p>Based on the data given, the second situation has happened. As you can see in the picture below:</p>

    <p>The car is clearly turning and not braking after that, similar to the second example given.</p>
